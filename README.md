## Performance
For AWS, we leverage eawsy's python based [AWS Lambda Go Shim](https://github.com/eawsy/aws-lambda-go-shim) for superior 
performance compared to Node.js shims:

## Features
- works with AWS Lambda event sources or API Gateway HTTP requests.
- go vendor support with default [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep). Can be swapped out easily.
- use `docker` and `docker-compose` for easy testing and ensure consistent dependencies across `golang`, `python` and `serverless`

## Usage
Prerequisites:
- have `serverless`, `go`, `make` and `docker`
- have correct `$GOPATH` and your new project must reside in `$GOPATH/src/path/your-app`

See each individual example for detailed instructions:
